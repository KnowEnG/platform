                <p>The consensus clustering data shown in this heatmap can be used
                to understand the performance of the bootstrapping step of the
                algorithm.
                </p>
                <p>The columns in this heatmap represent the samples in the data,
                and just as in all of the other heatmaps on this screen, the columns
                are ordered according to the column grouping and column sorting that
                have been set near the top of the visualization.
                </p>
                <p>The rows in this heatmap also represent the samples in the data.
                They are always ordered to match the ordering of the columns, so
                that this heatmap easier to interpret. If the column order is
                changed using the grouping and sorting controls near the top of the
                visualization, the row order will be updated automatically. Note
                that this heatmap does not have controls on the left for changing
                the row order, because the row ordering is automatic.
                </p>
                <p>The values in this heatmap represent how frequently, in all of
                the bootstrap iterations, each possible pairing of samples was
                assigned to the same cluster. If the <i>i</i>th column
                represents sample A and the <i>j</i>th row represents sample B,
                then the cell located at the intersection of the <i>i</i>th column
                and the <i>j</i>th row contains the proportion of bootstraps in which
                sample A and sample B were assigned to the same cluster. (This will
                be equal to the value in the <i>j</i>th column and the <i>i</i>th
                row.)
                </p>
                <p>Patterns in the cell values can reveal how stable the clusters
                are and whether any clusters might be similar to each other, among
                other things. It's also possible to change the column grouping near
                the top of the visualization to a row from your phenotype spreadsheet,
                if you provided one, to see how often samples from phenotype
                groups clustered together.
                </p>
                <p>Because assessing these patterns requires the full set of samples
                in at least one dimension, this heatmap will always show every row,
                even if only a subset of columns is currently visible because a
                group is expanded or birdseye view is disabled.
