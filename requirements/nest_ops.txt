# even though nest_ops needs the nest_flask and nest_jobs dependencies in order
# to run their unit tests, don't include nest_flask.txt or nest_jobs.txt here,
# because those files also include common.txt, and pip currently fails when any
# single library is included twice in the same pip invocation
# see https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/56
# the nest_ops Dockerfile will install the nest_flask and nest_job dependencies
