# bash entrypoint into the python ops code (compile, build, deploy, startup, shutdown, etc).
# hands off all commands to the python code running in the nest_ops container that has
# the necessary dependencies loaded.

 
# BEFORE FIRST RUN: 
# Before running the first time, you must build the nest_ops docker container:
# > sh docker/build_nest_ops.sh
#
# most likely need to make this file executable:
# > chmod u+x nest_ops
#
# If that succeeds, you should be able to run all other operations using nest_ops


# USAGE:
# To get up to date help:
# > nest_ops -h

#using -B to not save pycs generated by nest_ops: they would be saved as root
sh docker/start_nest_ops_container.sh python -B -m nest_py.ops.CMD_nest_ops "$@"
